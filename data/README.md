## bcp.txt

The 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Copied and pasted from the pages linked in the online Book of Common Prayer (https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer). Copied on July 29, 2024.

Titles, words indicating the speaker (Minister, People, Answer, etc.), and other short phrases with little significance are omitted. The tables are omitted. The psalms outside of "The Psalter" are omitted to avoid redundancy. "A Table of Kindred and Affinity" and "The Psalter - Verse Numbering Differences" are omitted.

To avoid confusion, square brackets (\[text\]) are removed. To fit the text to the proper grammar, some of the sentences that included square brackets are either altered or removed.

To disambiguate the endings of the sentences, '&c.' is changed to '&c' whenever it is not the last word of a sentence. Thus all appearances of a period mark (.) indicate the end of a sentence.

When an entire sentence or clause is within parentheses, the parentheses are removed, and the sentence is preserved.

There were four sections in the reproduction of The 1662 Book of Common Prayer as printed by John Baskerville in 1762 (https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/the-book-of-common-prayer-1662.pdf) which were not included in the online Book of Common Prayer. They are "A Form of Prayer for the 5th Day of November, being the Day kept in memory of the Papists Conspiracy," "A Form of Prayer for the 30th Day of January, being the Day kept in memory of the Martyrdom of King Charles the First," "A Form of Prayer for the 29th Day of May, being the Day kept in memory of the Birth and Return of King Charles the Second," and "A Form of Prayer for the 25th Day of October, being the Day on which His Maje≈øty began his happy Reign." These sections are copied and pasted from the PDF file linked above.
