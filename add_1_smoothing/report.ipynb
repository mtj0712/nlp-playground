The high cross entropy and perplexity are expected, since a unigram model is far from sufficient in representing an actual language. The fact that they are lower than those of the model trained with the King James Version might be due to the smaller vocabulary. As expected, the most probable words are some common punctuations and grammatical words, such as articles, prepositions, and pronouns.\n",
