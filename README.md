# nlp-playground

This is the repository where I explore various NLP-related techniques and algorithms.

## test/

Here, I tried out a basic neural network with stochastic gradient descent. The results were not so promising - it is probably due to high bias of my model's hyperparameters.

## add_1_smoothing/

Here, I am developing n-gram models based on two English corpora - King James Version of the Bible and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - and apply add-one smoothing.
