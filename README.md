# nlp-playground

This is the repository where I explore various NLP-related techniques and algorithms.

## test/

Here, I tried out a basic neural network with stochastic gradient descent. The results were not so promising - it is probably due to high bias of my model's hyperparameters.

## add_1_smoothing/

Here, I develop n-gram models for Early Modern English and Modern English. The models for Early Modern English are based on The 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the King James Version of the Bible, and The Complete Works of Shakespeare. The models for Modern English are based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Add-one smoothing method is tried on these models.
